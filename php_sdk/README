This is a completely separate and self-contained "project" within the scheduler 
project. 

It is the corresponding SDK for interfacing with the scheduler's API, and hence
there will be significant overlaps.
Whenever the API is updated, updates to the SDK should take place as necessary 
so that the SDK is always in sync with what it is relating to.
e.g. revision 301 of the scheduler should work with revision 301 of the sdk 
found within it.

Having this in a separate repo could cause confusion and people may struggle
to find the sdk that matches a specific previous revision of the scheduler 
should we wish to roll back.
